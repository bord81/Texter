Read your Twitter feed in a new way.

I must admit, that I like to read Twitter, but feel a bit distracted by all the image and video stuff.
It's a short-texts sharing platform in the first place, isn't it?
So I decided to make simple news feed reader without image loading.

The news feed presented is a 'home timeline' for the logged in user. You can 'like' or 'retweet' other people's posts and open them in browser. However for the full Twitter expirience, you should use the official app or website.

Under the hood it uses Retrofit and Picasso for requesting data from Twitter REST APIs.
The example source code as well as APK can be found here.
If you are interested in Twitter apps development, you may also take a look at small util called 'twac' in the 'useful-stuff' repo.
